private let readMe = """
  This example demonstrates how to present a new screen conditionally based on the application's state.
  
  Key Features:
  - Leverages SwiftUI's `.sheet` modifier to present a new screen modally.
  - Uses the presenter's state (`PresentState`) to control when the presentation occurs.
  - Includes a binding mechanism that seamlessly synchronizes state changes with the UI.
  
  Use Cases:
  - Dynamically present a detail view only when specific data is available.
  - Learn how to use presenters to manage modal presentations in a structured and testable way.
  - Understand the role of state-driven UI updates in managing complex screen flows.
  
  This example is ideal for understanding modal presentations and how they can be tied to a state management system in SwiftUI.
